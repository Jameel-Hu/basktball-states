# NBA task
In this task I have been supplied data for two more additional in-game statistics:
• Free Throws
• Free Throw Attempts
I  created three plots that portray the following insights:
• Free Throw Attempts per game
• Accuracy of Free Throws
• Player playing style (2 vs 3 points preference) excluding Free Throws*
*Each Free Throw is worth 1 point
The data has been supplied in the form of vectors. I created the two
matrices then proceed with the analysis
